The Hotel Management System is a database project designed to manage various operations within a hotel. It includes managing customer bookings, staff details, room availability, payments, and service requests. The system is built using SQL, and the database design is based on key relationships between entities like customers, rooms, bookings, payments, and services.

The system consists of several tables, each representing a different entity in the hotel management system:

    Customers: Stores information about customers.
    Rooms: Contains details of different types of rooms available in the hotel.
    Bookings: Records bookings made by customers, including check-in and check-out details.
    Payments: Tracks payments made by customers for their bookings.
    Staff: Contains details about hotel staff.
    Services: Lists additional services offered by the hotel.
    Service Requests: Tracks the services requested by customers during their stay.
